\chapter{EXPECTED OUTPUT}
Dehra is an multi platform application to make renting rooms easier for average citizen. The room renter can find rooms in any location s/he prefers and can contact the owner through the application which removes calls from unknown number for owner making it easier for owner to know who are interested. Although the location is given, to give map of the owner's room, owner needs to approve making it more secure for the owner and the map navigation feature helps the renter reach the destination easier. Both renter and owner can provide feedback which can be analysed to make the application better on future versions.
