A place to stay is always has been the one of the important parts of  human’s day to day life. Similarly, in the case of Nepal, according to Annual Household Survey 2016/2017 by CBS, Nepal \cite{householdsurvey} which was released in 2019, 24.7 percent of people in urban areas don’t own their own house either choosing to stay in an apartment or rent a room however from talking with various people from different places of our locality, people have problem finding rooms in the place they want and compare for the best price they can get. Applications that do exist which have tried to solve this problem seems to be missing more function which could be integrated in order to make life of people easier. Even on the context of current situation, where the world is suffering from world-wide COVID-19 pandemic the option of choosing the best option for them and contacting the house owner and renter before the room is actually rented virtually has been even more necessary with the choice of showing the actual way towards the house for a person who want to rent in order for them to come in contact with as less people as possible is more important in current scenario. Not only for current situation but even in the world when there are no more huge implications by COVID, features as such could help day-to-day people get rooms efficiently and room renters to get their preferred choice i.e. most people prefer certain types of people to rent their rooms such as students.
